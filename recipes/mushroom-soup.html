    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This <strong>Vegan Gluten-Free</strong> Mushroom Soup is a hearty, creamy dish that combines the rich umami flavor of mushrooms with the smoothness of coconut milk. It begins with sautéing onions, fresh mushrooms, and dried thyme in olive oil until tender and aromatic. Then, vegetable broth, bay leaves, and gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) are added and brought to a boil. To thicken the soup, a cornstarch-water mixture is stirred in, followed by coconut milk, salt, and black pepper. The soup is simmered until the coconut milk is heated through, resulting in a velvety texture and rich flavor.</p>

    <p>This recipe is both vegan and gluten-free, making it suitable for a variety of dietary preferences. It serves four and can be prepared in approximately 40 minutes. For those who prefer a different flavor profile, almond milk can be substituted for coconut milk, and gluten-free liquid aminos can replace soy sauce. The soup is versatile and can be enjoyed as a main course or paired with crusty bread for a comforting meal.</p>

            Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; pour into soup and stir well to incorporate. Reduce heat and simmer soup until it starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add coconut milk, salt, and black pepper. Simmer just until coconut milk is heated through (do not allow to boil), about 5 minutes.
