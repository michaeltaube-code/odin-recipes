        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>These <strong>Vegan</strong> and <strong>Gluten-Free</strong> Orange Muffins are a delightful treat that combines the natural sweetness of coconut sugar with the bright, citrusy flavor of fresh orange juice and zest. The recipe is straightforward, requiring only a blender to combine gluten-free rolled oats, almond milk, and a few pantry staples into a smooth batter. This simplicity makes it accessible for both novice and seasoned bakers.</p>
    
        <p>Baked at 190°C (375°F) for about 22 minutes, the muffins emerge with a golden    top that springs back when lightly pressed, indicating their perfect texture. Each muffin is under 200 calories, making them a wholesome option for breakfast or a snack. For those with dietary preferences, the recipe offers flexibility; any non-dairy milk can be substituted for almond milk, and the muffins can be enjoyed warm with a spread of vegan butter for added richness.</p>
